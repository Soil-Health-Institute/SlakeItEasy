Version: 1.0.2
Author: Nate Looker
Maintainer: Nate Looker <nlooker@soilhealthinstitute.org>
Description: Utility functions to determine the projected area of soil
    during slaking tests, following Fajardo et al. (2016)
    <doi:10.1016/j.still.2016.05.018>. Functions are designed for output
    of high-throughput image aquisition schemes (e.g., multiple
